# Grapholio 🧠📈  
**GNN-based Portfolio Optimization Environment**

Grapholio is a modular, research-grade framework for simulating financial markets as dynamic graphs and training reinforcement learning agents to optimize portfolios.

---

## 📌 Features

- Models the market as **daily graphs** using rolling correlations
- Node features = **financial signals** (return, volatility)
- RL environment is built using **OpenAI Gym**
- Observations are PyTorch Geometric graphs
- Includes a **GNN-based policy network** that outputs portfolio allocations
- Interactive HTML visualizations (via Plotly)
- Fully modular structure — ready for RL agent integration (PPO, A2C, SAC, etc.)
